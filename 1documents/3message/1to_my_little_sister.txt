To my darling little sister,

If you’re reading this… then it means I didn’t make it. I tried to hide this letter somewhere safe, somewhere they'd overlook. Somewhere only someone who really knew me — or needed to know me — would ever find it.

I’m sorry. God, I’m so sorry.

I wanted to be there for you. I wanted to see you grow up. I wanted to braid your hair and walk you to school and tell you that the world was big and beautiful and worth exploring. I wanted to show you how to run command lines and how to hotwire a system when it’s trying to lie to you. I wanted to protect you.

But I couldn’t even protect myself.

The system I was working on — CENTINEL-1 — it was never just a firewall. That was the cover story. It was a door. And behind that door, the people I worked for were building something that wasn’t just code. It was meant to control people — maybe even break them down and rebuild them from the inside out. They called it security. But it wasn’t security. It was a weapon.

A bioweapon.

They used my skills to guard it. Wrap it in encryption. Keep it invisible. I didn’t know at first — but when I did... I couldn’t walk away. I couldn’t unsee it.

So I burned it.

On my last day, I triggered the failsafe I’d been building in secret — the one stitched together through all the late nights and phantom logs and missing reports. I wiped every trace of the mainframe and scrambled every backup node I could find. I watched it spark. I watched it fail. I knew they'd be coming for me after that. Honestly, I thought I’d have more time. Enough time to send a message. To run. To say goodbye.

I didn’t.

But I did leave them something. Call it an easter egg. A signature. A scar.

If they ever try to build something like this again, my systems will know. They’ll light up like flares. They’ll shout it from every public server and broadcast tower I ever touched. They'll see what I saw. The secrets won't stay buried. Not this time.

And I left clues — little contingencies tucked away in drives and directories and old bootlegged games. You’re reading this now because you found one. Maybe it felt like a scavenger hunt. Maybe it was. One last puzzle. One last trace of me.

You are the only thing I ever truly wanted to protect. And even now, even after everything, I hope that’s still possible.

Stay sharp. Stay quiet. And if they come for you — don’t be brave. Just be gone before they can catch you.

All my love,
Alice

P.S. Don’t drink the smoothies. Just... trust me. They’re so gross ;)
